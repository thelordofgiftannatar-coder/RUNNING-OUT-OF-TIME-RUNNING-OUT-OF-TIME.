# Officer K — Android APK project

This repository wraps the supplied `index.html` media player in a Capacitor Android app and builds a debug APK with GitHub Actions.

## Build the APK with GitHub

1. Create a new, empty repository on GitHub.
2. Extract this ZIP on your computer.
3. Upload **the contents** of the extracted `officer-kd6-android` folder to the repository (the `.github` folder must be included).
4. Open the repository's **Actions** tab.
5. Select **Build Officer K Android APK** and press **Run workflow** (or push/commit to `main` or `master`).
6. When the run finishes, open it and download the artifact named **Officer-K-debug-APK**.
7. Extract the downloaded artifact. Install `app-debug.apk` on your Android phone. If Android asks, allow installation from that source.

## Notes

- This is a debug APK for testing/sideloading, not a Play Store-signed release.
- The original HTML app is kept in `www/index.html`.
- The original app's built-in browser-based file picker and media features remain in place.
- The HTML references optional native plugins named `LocalMusic`, `MediaSession`, and `CapacitorShareTarget`. This ZIP does not implement those custom native plugins; native-only features depending on them may not work until those plugins are added. The APK build itself does not depend on them.
- Internet-based features and external CDN libraries still require an internet connection.

## Notification-panel media player

The build adds a native `MediaSession` plugin + foreground service (`assets/android-java/`). While music plays you get a player in the notification panel / lock screen with cover, seek bar, previous, play/pause, next and **Stop**. On Android 13+ allow the "Notifications" prompt the first time you open the app.

### If the panel doesn't appear
Temporary toasts and a test panel (3 s after launch) help diagnose it; set `DEBUG = false` in `MediaPlaybackService.java` to remove them.
1. "sending 'playing' to the player panel" → the app reached the native plugin.
2. "player panel service started" → the service is running.
3. A red-flag toast ("Notifications are OFF…") → enable notifications for Officer K in Android settings.
